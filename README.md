# About

This is a tiny MATLAB plotting tool for PX4 ULog data, inspired by [matulog](https://github.com/CarlOlsson/matulog).
It allows you to customize and visualize the signals you are interested in.

The tool has been tested on macOS and Windows 10, using MATLAB.

⸻

# Requirements
1. MATLAB
2. Python (installed and accessible from the system PATH)
3. pyulog — required for running ulog_matlab_plot

You can install pyulog via:

```
pip install pyulog
```

or

```
pip3 install pyulog
```

On macOS, pyulog may already be installed if you have previously set up the PX4 development environment using

```
brew install px4-dev
```

In that case, you can locate the ulog2csv tool with:

```
which ulog2csv
```



# Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy your `.ulg` files to `/data`
3. In MATLAB, configure the file path and file name, then run:

```
plot_setpoint_response.m
```



# Notes

If you see the following warning when installing or running pyulog, it means the installation path is not on your system PATH variable:

WARNING: The scripts ulog2csv, ulog2kml, ulog2rosbag, ulog_extract_gps_dump, 
ulog_info, ulog_messages, ulog_migratedb, and ulog_params are installed in 
'/Users/mch/Library/Python/3.8/bin' which is not on PATH.
Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning,
use --no-warn-script-location.

Simply add the shown directory to your PATH or ignore the warning if you prefer.
